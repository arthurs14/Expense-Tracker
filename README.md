# Transition Expense Tracker to React from HTML-CSS-JavaScript Project 

I am transforming a project that was strictly made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a React project that will also have a backend once the functionality works.

## Installation

1. cd client npm install or yarn install, then npm start or yarn start
2. cd server npm install or yarn install, then npm start or yarn start
